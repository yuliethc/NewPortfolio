At Escobedo Medina Auditores Asociados, I had the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to the development of various projects. During my time there, I acquired solid foundation as a Fullstack Developer, equipped with the ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver innovative software solutions. I played a key role in the following responsibilities:

- Web-based ERP Development: I was actively involved in the development of a web-based ERP system called Contatrib ERP - Mi factura Peru. This encompassed all stages of the development process, from problem analysis and user research to database modeling, creation of tables, functions, store procedures, and triggers. I also created API routes, designed UI & UX, and carried out front-end development using technologies such as React JS, Node.js/Express, MySQL, Adobe Photoshop, and Adobe XD.

- Desktop App Enhancement: I worked on enhancing a desktop application built with VB .NET and MySQL. This application facilitated administrative functions necessary for generating electronic invoices in a multi-business system. I maintained and improved existing features, while also developing new functionalities to meet evolving business requirements.

- Throughout my 1.5 years at Escobedo Medina Auditores Asociados, I gained valuable experience in full-stack development, acquiring a deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies. This role allowed me to expand my knowledge and skills in areas such as React JS, Node.js/Express, VB .NET, MySQL, and UI/UX design.

- Working closely with the team, I developed an appreciation for the importance of collaboration and effective communication in achieving project success. I thrived in a dynamic and fast-paced environment, adapting to evolving client needs and delivering high-quality solutions.
