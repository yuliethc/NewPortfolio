At Escobedo Medina Auditores Asociados, I had the opportunity to contribute my skills and expertise to the development of various projects. During my time there, I acquired solid foundation as a Fullstack Developer, equipped with the ability to tackle complex challenges and deliver innovative software solutions. I played a key role in the following responsibilities:

- Web-based ERP Development

- Desktop App Enhancement

- Deep understanding of both front-end and back-end technologies: React JS, Node.js/Express, VB .NET, MySQL, and UI/UX design.

- Team working, collaboration and effective communication.
